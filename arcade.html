                <p> In May of 2016 I began working at my local arcade. This arcade featured laser tag, bumber cars, escape rooms, and some arcade games obviously.
                    I was responsible for doing pretty much everything, but spent most of my time running laser tag games.

                <h2>My Experience at the Arcade</h2>
                <p>I'll probably never find a better job. Even though the pay was literal garbage.
                </p> Being my first job, the arcade served as a place where I learned some valuable lessons, made lifelong friends, and matured into an adult.
                I quickly took a liking to everyone that worked at the arcade. I'll give you a quick rundown of some of my favorite characters. First there is my
                main manager, we'll call him Charley. Charley was a really wacky, zany guy with a heart of gold. He kind of comes off as a creepy old man, but he quickly 
                became one of my best friends on the job. Next there is Keith. Keith is an interesting fellow. After serving 17 years in prison he found himself "working"
                at the arcade. Working is written in quotes because Keith spent most of his time walking around and yelling at unsuspecting children and cleaning up every now
                and then. I could always rely on Keith to tell it like it is, the dude didn't hold back. Lastly, theres Jeremy. Jeremy was my favorite manager because he treated me like
                a manager of sorts. 

                <p> Working at the arcade was easy, but not too easy. Like I said before I spent most of my time running laser tag games. Running laser tag consisted
                    of standing in a dark room for 15 minutes while hoping that the children you are responsible for don't get hurt. I also spent alot of time messing around.
                    You see, my entire friend group eventually started working at the arcade. We owned the arcade. There was really nothing quite like it. We probably drank five 
                    thousand dollars worth of pop at the employee soda machine collectively. In general I enjoyed working at the arcade, unless I was scheduled for a saturday. Saturdays
                    were by far the busiest days for the arcade and working one meant that you were going to be helping five different customers with five different problems at any given moment.
                    Monday mornings were the complete opposite. The store opened at 8am for whatever reason. I'm really not sure why. We never got customers before 11am on mondays. I didn't mind, 
                    it gave me more time to do nothing and get paid for it.

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <li>
                        <p>Don't eat food you found in the communal fridge. One friday night I got unusually hungry and asked my manager if I could have food that another coworker
                            left in the fridge. He didn't care so I ate a brownie I found. I went on with my life and continued to run laser tag games. Two laser tag games later I was 
                            waiting outside laser tag door to admin cutomers for the next game when I noticed that I felt really strange. I couldnt stop looking at the floor, for some reason
                            I was suddenly fascinated by the way it looked under the blacklights. With customers waiting on me inside the laser tag room, I continued to stare at the ground. I couldnt tell
                            you how long I just stood there and stared at the ground. I was broken out of my trance when I noticed a woman was standing in front of me and asking me when I was 
                            going to start the game. Like I said, I dont know how long I stood there before I noticed this woman, but based on how she looked at me when I finally responed I've assumed
                            it was a while. The woman looked at me like I was insane. I went inside and started the game. I realized that I was really, really high. There was cannabis in the brownie I snagged.
