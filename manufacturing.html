                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>In the summer of 2020 my brother, bestfriend, and I moved up north to Harbor Beach Michigan to work in a mask manufacturing plant.
                    We did this on the pretense of a pretty sweet deal offered by our new employers. My employer offered to rent the three of us a house and
                    pay for our utilities. They even payed for our internet! The job itself was handling the operation of a mask making machine from midnight to
                    eight in the morning. We were told the machine would run itself and would require minimal interaction. Aside from having to work the night shift, we thought it was a pretty sweet deal for a couple of young guys like ourselves 
                    that had spent the past few months locked inside due to a global pandemic. We'd come to realize later that this deal wasnt all that was initially advertised.

                <h2>My Experience with the Mask Job</h2>
                <p>Long story short, I came to absolutely hate this job. I will tell you exactly why.
                </p>
                <p>When we arrived for our first day of work, we met two technicians that were working to get the machine up and running. Before I get in to how much
                    this machine sucked I would like to say that I have immense respect for the two technicians, as they worked around the clock to maintain a machine
                    that they knew virtually nothing about. The problem was that the machine was Chinese-made, so any documentation on it was written in mandarin, that is 
                    if you could find said documentation in depths of the internet. Another issue was that the mask fabric we fed the machine was not the same fabric it was designed for.
                    Because of this, many of the automated features of the machine had to be done manually and became my responsibility. The machine itself consisted of two main components:
                    the component that made the mask itself, and the component that attached the ear loops. The machine is supposed to press the masks and use conveyors to move them to the ear
                    loop welders. From here another conveyor moves the completed mask to the packaging site. The conveyors did not work as they were suppposed to due to the nature of the fabric we
                    were supplied, so the three of us had to manually move the incomplete masks to the welders, manually operate the welders, and then carry stacks of masks to where they would be packaged.
                    Doesn't sound that bad right? Wrong. My responsibilities would have been no issue if the machine didn't jam or break or malfunction every 10 minutes. For months 
                    my brother, best friend, and I spent more time fixing the machine than we did actually making masks. This became incredibly tedious and annoying as the job was initially 
                    advertised as "just sit there and get paid". After the first few weeks we would hope and pray that the machine had completely broken down on another shift so that we
                    wouldn't have to come in. Around this time by body began to feel the stress of working the night shift and developed a severe case of insomnia. I became depressed and neglected my
                    nutritional needs. I felt like I was always at work. I would fall asleep at work and never felt awake enough to guarantee that I wasn't about to lose a finger in the welder
                    or accidentally remove one of my coworker's fingers. This is a gross summarization of my time with the mask job, I could complain all day and night about that damn machine.
                    The only day I was happy in that manufacturing plant was when I told my boss that the three of us were quitting.

                    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
                    <li>
                        <p>Don't work the night shift if you don't have to. Avoid it like the plague. Working nights destroys your mind, body, and soul. This is especially true if you are someone that 
                        has always struggled to get sleep, like myself.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <p>Your boss' boss only cares about money. We were very vocal about our difficulties with the machine. Our boss understood these concerns, but our boss' boss
                        did not.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <p>You don't owe your employer anything, especially if you are doing your job as you should. I felt like I owed my employers everything because they pretty
                        much financed my living situation while I worked for them. I felt that quitting this job I hated would be both morally and ethically wrong. I learned that this 
                        is a horrible mentality. You must put yourself first in everything you do. You have the power to remove yourself from situations you dont want to be in.
                        </p>
